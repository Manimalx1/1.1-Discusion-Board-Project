Although most of the writing is in a laguage i cant read, i really enjoy the format of this application. It shows up to date open source projects. It would be a good
place to look for more open source projects if they needed more ideas. It looks and acts like a Facebook but for code.
People could potentially use this application to advertise their work.

https://github.com/github/gitignore
This is a template file on ways to use .gitignore. There are multiple different ways to implement the code.

https://github.com/MegaChibisX/MegaMan-Unity-8Bit-Engine
As a future game developer i love the idea of a arcade game remade on a unity platform. I actually downloaded this and tried it out. other than a few minor bugs
the game preforms very well.

https://github.com/trolit/projectZero
project zero is another game i would recommend tring for future game developers. its a good way to look at how the code is used to make the game playable. 
The graphics are not the best they could be. However, the games it has on there platform are goofy.

https://github.com/Amiryy/tic-tac-toe-react-redux
This is another game, but its tic-tac-toe. The creator made a 3x3 grid and a 4x4 grid. They also implemented a bot function that has different dificulties.
The game looks and plays beautifuly. I would recommend trying to beat the bot it was harder then i thought it would be.
